    "\n",
    "Expressions of the form `name1 = object1` assign names (`name1`) to Python objects (`object1`). The names are also called variables and instead of assigning we talk of binding. What happens when you bind a name to an object, is that the Python object is stored in the memory of your machine and the name/variable is a reference to the object stored in the memory. When you execute `name2 = name1`, then both names are referring to the same object in memory (there is no copy of the object created).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fundamental difference between mutable object types and immutable object types. After binding a name to a mutable object (i.e. store this object in the memory of your machine), the object can still be changed while keeping the same location in the memory of your machine and keeping the same name that is referring to this object. For immutable objects, this is not possible. \"Changing\" an immutable object always means creating a new object in memory. The name will subsequently refer to the new object. Examples of mutable objects are lists, dicts and NumPy arrays (see below). Examples of immutable objects are ints, strings and tuples."

Notice that by appending 4 to `a`, one merely changes the already existing object that both `a` and `b` are referring to. One does not create a new object.
